Beyond helping with the core code, we hope the permissionless and open source nature of the project means you will build new services on top of the existing network.</p><p>You can also <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/address/3MXYUBLWNETa5HTewZp1xMTt7AW9kbFNqs\" target=\"_blank\">donate Bitcoin</a> to the project, which will be used to defray costs for visiting conferences, offering bounties for development, and promoting OpenBazaar.</p><p>Please <a href=\"https://slack.openbazaar.org/\" target=\"_blank\">join our Slack</a> if you have new ideas for OpenBazaar, or have questions for the core devs.</p>",
